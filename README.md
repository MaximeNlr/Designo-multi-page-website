## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size  
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site  
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (using Google Maps API in this solution)

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)  
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  
- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- Flexbox  
- CSS Grid  
- Mobile-first workflow  
- Google Maps API integration  

### What I learned

This project mostly helped me consolidate things I had already worked with before (React + Tailwind).  
The main new thing for me was integrating **Google Maps API** on the locations page.  

### Continued development

- Adding more **animations** to improve user experience  
- Learning and practicing with **Next.js**, which will be my next step
